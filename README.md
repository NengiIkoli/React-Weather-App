#wha# 🌦️ Weather App

You will be building a **React application** similar to the demo below. This application will enhance your existing knowledge of **React basics** (components, JSX, props, event handling, using forms, making API calls, basic hooks) and allow you to practice with **React best practices**.

Below you will see a demo of the **Weather Application** that will load data from the OpenWeather API based on a location of choice. The application will display the **weather for the current day**.

## 📌 Requirements

✅ **No code should be merged into `main`** until all **console and terminal errors/warnings** are corrected.  
✅ Upon **initial render**, your app should load **one-day weather details** for the **default location** of your choice.  
✅ Your app should have a **search bar** that allows a user to specify a **new location** to search. After the user searches, the app should render **weather forecast data** for the new location.  
✅ The user of your app should be able to enter **either a city/state, a zip code, an address, or a landmark** for their search term. If your weather API relies on a **latitude/longitude (lat/lon)** for search, use a **geocoder** to convert the human-friendly search into location coordinates.  
✅ Each **component's props should be destructured** for **readability**.  
✅ Pull data from your external APIs using **Axios or Fetch**.  
✅ **Hide API keys** using a `.env.local` file.  
✅ Your app should have **multiple components**. Use **props** to pass data from **parent components** into **child components** to allow customization of the child components. *(Sometimes it's easiest to start with one or two big components, and then break code out into smaller, more specific components after the core functionality is in place.)*
