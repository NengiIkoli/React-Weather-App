# 🌦️ **Weather App**

I built this **React Weather App** to enhance my skills in **React basics**, including components, JSX, props, event handling, using forms, making API calls, and working with React best practices.

This app pulls real-time weather data from the **OpenWeather API** based on a user’s selected location. It allows users to search for a city, zip code, or landmark and returns the weather forecast for the current day.
